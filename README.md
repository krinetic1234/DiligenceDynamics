# Sprint 1 Goals (Individual Contributions)

- Krish Maniar: basic UI frontend, testing financial data retrieval on GPT-4 and other open-source models
- Justin Lim: This sprint, I helped create our figma mocks, interviewed multiple investors/analysts for need-finding, and added a basic sidebar with routing to our web application. I also worked on setting up and running our first multi-modal RAG system, and created the demo video that demonstrates its ability to accurately parse data from tables and text. Note, the code for that pipeline is in a colab notebook and isn't in the github yet. Next sprint, I will focus on building out the front end and improving the model.
- Winston Shum
- Collin Jung
- Jakob Nordhagen: 
    - **This sprint:** Broadly, my contributions to Sprint 1 consisted of research, development, and experimentation. I investigated the current state of the market for our type of product in order to understand where our application will fit in, finding that AlphaSense is the solution to beat. I experimented with a RAG model for parsing documents with Langchain (loosely collaborating with Winston and Justin) and I implemented a basic login/signup modal component with React Bootstrap.
    - **Going forward:** During the next sprint, I expect to focus on integrating LLM functionality into our app, as well as building out a backend and augmenting/redesigning our current frontend. I may also work on brainstorming new features to build in other than our main RAG document-based QA solution, as I believe we will ultimately need more in order for our project to be compelling.
